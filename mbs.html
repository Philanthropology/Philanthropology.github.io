                    The idea of this project was to represent the qualities of my mind, body, and spirit through a found image triptych.  I came up with a set of words to describe myself and found images to represent those words.  
                    The image representing my mind is a scene behind the wheel of a car driving into a surreal landscape where the horizon cracks and warps.  This was to show how my mind can make up stories and believe them.  This can be to a fault, but can also be harnessed and used in a creative outlet.  The body piece shows motion and activity.  I need to be able to move and work my body so that my mind isnâ€™t working overtime.  The peacock and city represent my need to explore as well as my need to show off at times.  The spirit image shows depth through the quarry acting as a border between a night sky with pixelated clouds and a tagged wall.  The disorganized way that these images are layed out speaks to my spirit not being tied down.  I will always be imperfect, but will always learn.  
                    My mind, body, and spirit are all linked together, yet they are represented through found images in very different ways.  It was difficult to pin down a set of words to describe these three parts of me, so I made the images in a way that allows the viewer to create a story around them.  </br></br>
