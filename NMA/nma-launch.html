                The Continue Triangle

                    The goal of this project was to make a New Media website.<br>  Of the pages we studied in class many of them had dark themes either hidden or in plain sight.<br>
                    I was inspired by the dark tone of New Media Art projects from the early 2000’s in my own work. <br>
                    Based off the randomly generated sentence, “Strategy focused on the continue triangle” I began thinking about what the continue triangle might mean.<br>
                    I came up with the idea that it would be a formula for immortality.<br>   
                    The project takes the viewer throughout a facility where live animals are being held and monitored.<br> 
                    These animals are tested on and eventually used in experiments to create a chimera of regular farm animals.<br>  
                    In concept, the living being shown on the “Demonstration” page is immortal but obviously still in progress.  
                    This is the strategy focused on the continue triangle. <br><br>
